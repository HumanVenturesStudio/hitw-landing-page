  <dt tabIndex="1">Why do I need this?</dt>
  <dd>

In cultures all around the world (from East Asia to Latin America and West Africa), the focus during the postpartum period is all around recovering the woman through care and nutrition, because people understood that helping the mother thrive is the first step to a healthy, happy baby.

Much of this is a lost art in today’s culture, and women have remarkable rates of postpartum depression and anxiety, feelings of isolation, and helplessness.  nu me is on a mission to help postpartum women by bringing centuries-old, tried & true ingredients, herbs, and spices to expedite healing and promote a successful long-term recovery, targeting the internal wound and physical exertion that a woman’s body encounters through birth as well as aid in breastfeeding.

Made for all the powerful, incredible women who have given birth and want one less thing to worry (aka. their own nutrition & how to take care of themselves) about with a newborn.

TL;DR: Detoxes & depuffs.   Heals & replenishes lost blood & nutrients.  Rejuvenates & energizes.  Prevents future long-term ailments and premature aging.

Packed with quality, flash-frozen, powderized functional foods, Traditional Chinese Medicine herbs and Ayurvedic spices, nu me’s quintessential power powders are formulated through a deep understanding for ancient healing ingredients from around the world that have been used for thousands of years.  Often, these ingredients are inaccessible or time-consuming to prepare, especially for a mother juggling a newborn.  With modern food science, we’re able to tap into these ancient ingredients, combined with quality functional foods, to provide a nutrient-dense powder that can be prepared easily to promote a better recovery and long term healing for women.
