        content: `In cultures all around the world (from Asia to Latin America and Africa), the focus during the postpartum period is all around recovering the woman through care and nutrition, because people understood that helping the mother thrive is the first step to a healthy, happy baby.
        Much of this is a lost art in today’s culture, and women have remarkable rates of postpartum depression and anxiety, feelings of isolation, and helplessness. Society prioritizes "snapping back in shape" and urging mothers to "do it all" without providing the tools or systems to properly support women.
        The act of giving birth creates a plate-sized wound in our bodies, which needs repair.  Pregnancy and birth also transition many essentials of health from the mom to the baby, leaving mothers depleted.  This healing cannot be rushed and must be done intentionally.
        nu me is on a mission to help postpartum women by bringing centuries-old, tried & true ingredients, herbs, and spices to expedite healing and promote a successful long-term recovery, targeting the internal wound and physical exertion that a woman’s body encounters through birth as well as aid in breastfeeding.  We formulated easy, convenient powders that you can prepare single-handedly with hot water to sip your way back into thriving health.`,

        content: `Made for all the powerful, incredible women who have given birth and want one less thing to worry (aka. their own nutrition & how to take care of themselves) about with a newborn.
        If you're giving birth soon (good luck!), this is for you - you'll thank yourself for preparing in advance when life feels all about the baby afterwards.
        If you've JUST given birth (you hero, you), this is for you - your body needs to replenish lost nutrients and energy above and beyond a regular diet.  The 4th trimester concept doesn't only apply to the baby; the first 6 weeks are absolutely critical for your recovery and journey to long term health, preventing future ailments that can range from PPD to pelvic floor issues and migraines.
        If you gave birth years ago, this is STILL for you - it's never too late to replenish and nourish our bodies.  You know that your body transformed after giving birth; this is a chance to transform it for the better.  Whether you look from a nutritional perspective (magenisum, iron, zinc, iodine, B vitamins, collagen, protein) or from an Eastern functional medicine point of view (heat, vata, energy, qi), your body can benefit from replenishing these lost essentials.`,

        Packed with quality, flash-frozen, powderized functional foods, Traditional Chinese Medicine herbs and Ayurvedic spices, nu me’s quintessential power powders are formulated through a deep understanding for ancient healing ingredients from around the world that have been used for thousands of years. Often, these ingredients are inaccessible or time-consuming to prepare, especially for a mother juggling a newborn. With modern food science, we’re able to tap into these ancient ingredients, combined with quality functional foods, to provide a nutrient-dense powder that can be prepared easily to promote a better recovery and long term healing for women.`,
